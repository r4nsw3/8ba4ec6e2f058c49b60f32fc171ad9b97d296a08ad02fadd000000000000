    Go bananas for a jaw-dropping, lightning-fast kart racer for all ages 
    and abilities! All-Star Fruit Racing propels players into vibrant 
    worlds filled with incredible action: drift through looping bends, 
    soar over monumental jumps and defy gravity itself around tubular 
    tracks in an explosively colourful racer bursting with championships,
    modes and awe-inspiring sights!

    Features:
    - Jump into a bumper career mode! - Pick your favourite character and
      battle for the first-place trophy in a series of testing 
      championships. Balance speed and skill as you battle seven other 
      racers in a frantically fruity scrap for the podium and the all-
      important winners prizes, unlocking new characters, championships
      and kart parts along the way!
    - Master all the modes! - Called yourself the champion of the 
      champion? The journey has just begun! Create Custom Championships
      and select between three different difficulty settings and speeds
      to fine-tune your challenge, or dive into a range of different 
      gametypes including Dragster races, Hill Climbs, Elimination 
      races, Time Attacks and even modifier-filled modes that rewrite 
      the rulebook!
    - Dominate the seasons! - Burn rubber in 21 incredible courses 
      spread across five stunning worlds: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter 
      and Special Islands. Speed up volcanoes, around the twisting 
      bodies of giant snakes and between giant, kart-crushing snowballs
      on some of the craziest racing tracks ever imagined!
    - Fire up The Juicer! - Bruise your foes (and their egos) by un-
      leashing devastating fruit-based moves with the innovative Juicer
      power-up system. Collect different types of fruit as you race to
      fill up The Juicers liquid tanks, then custom-combine your juice
      tanks power to let loose a combo power-up. Will you let loose a 
      volley of different power-ups, or save all of your fruit power
      until your unique Mega-Juice move's ready to help you reach first
      place?
    - Take on friends and family! - Do not race alone! Share the All-Star
      Fruit Racing fun with everyone at home or on the move with two-, 
      three- and four-player split-screen action!
    - Customize your kart! - Unlock new parts as you play to help you 
      redesign, rebuild and recolor your dream ride. It is not just 
      about winning - it's about winning with style, and over 32.000 
      possible kart combinations await in the All-Star Fruit Racing 
      Garage...
